# AI Layer Invariants

This document is the canonical reference for every invariant the AI
layer depends on. When you change the AI layer, consult this list.
When you add a new invariant, append it here AND add the constraint
that enforces it.

## Why this exists

Round 12 (2026-05-13) of agent-layer review identified the structural
root cause of the bug-fix cycle: **the system encodes implicit
invariants in code, not in the database**. When two subsystems
interact, an invariant from one breaks the other silently. Codex
found a HIGH-severity bug (summarizer splitting tool_use/tool_result
pairs) and another HIGH-severity bug (restore RPC double-counting
counters) that both fit this pattern.

The fix is to encode invariants at the DB level wherever possible:
CHECK constraints, partial unique indexes, triggers, RPC
preconditions. Code can be wrong; the DB stays consistent. Each
invariant on this list is either DB-enforced or marked as a known gap.

## Doctrine

Before adding any feature to `src/lib/agent/`:
1. List its invariants below.
2. Add the constraint that enforces each (CHECK, trigger, RPC
   precondition).
3. If the invariant truly cannot be enforced at the DB level,
   document **why** and add a property-based test in
   `src/lib/agent/evals/` instead.

Code-level enforcement ("the function checks this before insert")
counts as **NOT ENFORCED** for the purpose of this doctrine. It
WILL drift over time across review rounds.

## Format

Each invariant has:
- **ID** (e.g. INV-1)
- **Statement** of the invariant
- **Enforced by** (constraint/trigger name + migration, or "NOT
  ENFORCED" + why)
- **Assumed by** (file:line where code relies on it)
- **History** (which review round originally surfaced it)

## Invariants

### INV-1: agent_messages.role='tool' rows have a matching tool_use earlier in the same conversation

- **Enforced by:** Trigger `agent_messages_tool_result_orphan_check` calling `staxis_check_tool_result_pairing()` (migration 0114, T12.11)
- **Assumed by:** [memory.ts toClaudeMessages](src/lib/agent/memory.ts), summarizer batch logic
- **History:** Surfaced by Codex round-12 finding #1

### INV-2: Summary batches must not split a tool_use/tool_result pair across the 50-row boundary

- **Enforced by:** Code in `trimTrailingOrphanToolUses()` ([summarizer.ts](src/lib/agent/summarizer.ts), T12.1). NOT enforced at DB level — would require RPC-side knowledge of batch contents.
- **Assumed by:** memory.ts replay; toClaudeMessages skips orphan tool rows.
- **Backstop:** INV-1's trigger catches the orphan if it ever lands.
- **History:** Surfaced by Codex round-12 finding #1.
- **TODO:** Consider RPC-side enforcement in a future round (have the apply RPC verify boundaries).

### INV-3: agent_prompts.content is non-empty (not NULL, not whitespace-only)

- **Enforced by:** CHECK constraint `agent_prompts_content_nonempty` (migration 0114)
- **Assumed by:** [prompts-store.ts loadFromDb + resolvePrompts](src/lib/agent/prompts-store.ts)
- **History:** Round-12 my-pass agent finding #2

### INV-4: After staxis_restore_conversation, message_count = SELECT count(*) FROM agent_messages

- **Enforced by:** Restore RPC's defensive recompute UPDATE (migration 0113)
- **Assumed by:** Summarization candidate filter, `/admin/agent` KPI
- **History:** Codex round-12 finding #2

### INV-5: Tool result content truncation cap is the same across all writers

- **Enforced by:** Single exported constant `MAX_TOOL_RESULT_CHARS` in [llm.ts](src/lib/agent/llm.ts) imported by every consumer. NOT enforced at DB level — would require a CHECK with a hardcoded number that drifts from the constant.
- **Assumed by:** llm.ts tool_result persistence, summarizer.ts formatter, evals runner.
- **History:** Round-12 senior-Anthropic-engineer finding #4

### INV-6: An agent_messages row cannot have both is_summary=true AND is_summarized=true

- **Enforced by:** CHECK constraint `agent_messages_summary_xor` (migration 0106)
- **Assumed by:** memory.ts replay, summarizer
- **History:** Round-10 F7

### INV-7: agent_conversations.message_count >= 0 AND unsummarized_message_count <= message_count

- **Enforced by:** CHECK constraints `agent_conversations_msg_count_nonneg` + `agent_conversations_unsummarized_bounds` (migration 0114)
- **Assumed by:** Summarization candidate filter, /admin/agent KPI
- **History:** Round-12 META analysis. The bump triggers from 0100/0105 had no bound — could go negative under weird interleavings.

### INV-8: agent_messages.role is in ('user','assistant','tool','system')

- **Enforced by:** CHECK constraint `agent_messages_role_enum` (migration 0114)
- **Assumed by:** memory.ts replay branches; if a row had role='admin' (typo), it would silently fall through.
- **History:** Round-12 META analysis (implicit since project start)

### INV-9: agent_messages with is_summary=true must have role='assistant'

- **Enforced by:** CHECK constraint `agent_messages_summary_is_assistant` (migration 0114)
- **Assumed by:** memory.ts replay (the is_summary branch only handles role=assistant)
- **History:** Round-12 META analysis

### INV-10: agent_messages rows with role='tool' must have a non-NULL tool_call_id

- **Enforced by:** CHECK constraint `agent_messages_tool_needs_call_id` (migration 0114)
- **Assumed by:** memory.ts toClaudeMessages (joins on tool_call_id), metrics route (tool error rate join)
- **History:** Round-12 META analysis

### INV-11: Trust-marker boundary tags are escaped in any content wrapped in them

- **Enforced by:** Code helper `escapeTrustMarkerContent` ([llm.ts](src/lib/agent/llm.ts), Round 12 T12.4 rename). Applied at every wrap site (llm.ts toClaudeMessages, summarizer formatter, memory.ts summary-wrap). NOT enforced at DB level.
- **Assumed by:** PROMPT_BASE trust rule
- **History:** Round-5 trust marker chain; Round-12 T12.6 extended to summary path

### INV-12: Active prompts cache invalidation propagates within 30s

- **Enforced by:** Cache TTL (`CACHE_TTL_MS=30_000` in [prompts-store.ts](src/lib/agent/prompts-store.ts)) — accepted trade-off documented in L2 design
- **Assumed by:** Admin prompt-editing workflow
- **History:** Round-2/L2

### INV-13: Streaming reservation finalize OR cancel always runs in the route's finally

- **Enforced by:** Code (`route.ts` finally block + sweep cron as backstop)
- **Assumed by:** Cost cap math
- **History:** Round-5, Round-7

### INV-14: agent_messages.is_summarized=true rows are excluded from the replay history

- **Enforced by:** Code filter in `loadConversation` + `lockLoadAndRecordUserTurn` RPC
- **Assumed by:** L4 part B (summarization)
- **History:** Round-10 F1

### INV-15: When MODEL_OVERRIDE.haiku is set, the summarizer uses that snapshot

- **Enforced by:** Code (`MODELS[model]` resolution in [llm.ts](src/lib/agent/llm.ts:62), used by summarizer via `runAgent({ model: 'haiku' })`)
- **Assumed by:** Operator rollback workflow when Anthropic ships a regression
- **History:** Round-11 T5

### INV-16: Only one prompt row per role can be is_active=true at a time

- **Enforced by:** Partial unique index `agent_prompts_active_per_role_uniq` (migration 0102)
- **Backstop:** Atomic `staxis_activate_prompt` RPC (migration 0106) inside one transaction
- **Assumed by:** prompts-store.ts (returns first match)
- **History:** Round-2 L2; Round-10 F5 added the atomic activate path

### INV-17: Cap math (user + property + global) ignores kind='background' rows

- **Enforced by:** Filter in `staxis_reserve_agent_spend` RPC (migration 0082) — `WHERE kind = 'request'`
- **Assumed by:** /admin/agent KPI separation, summarizer cost-tracking expectation
- **History:** Round-11 T2 (verified by review)

## Counter-heal mechanism

`staxis_heal_conversation_counters(p_dry_run boolean)` runs daily via
`/api/cron/agent-heal-counters` (cron, 04:00 UTC). It recomputes
`message_count` and `unsummarized_message_count` from `agent_messages`
for every conversation and either reports drift (p_dry_run=true) or
heals it (false). This is the safety net for INV-4 and INV-7.

When a heal event fires, it indicates a bug in trigger logic or an
RPC path that updated counters incorrectly. The cron logs to Sentry.
Investigate; don't just heal and move on.
